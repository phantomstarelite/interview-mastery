## 🚰 Pipes & Cisterns — From Zero to Interview Level

> Pipes & Cisterns = **Time & Work**,
> but instead of *men working*, we have *pipes filling or emptying a tank*.

## 🧠 PART 1: Core Idea (MOST IMPORTANT)

### 🔑 Replace the words in your brain

| Time & Work  | Pipes & Cisterns |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Work         | Tank             |
| Man          | Pipe             |
| Working      | Filling          |
| Leaving work | Emptying pipe    |

👉 **Same logic. Same math. Different story.**

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Types of Pipes

### 🔹 Inlet Pipe (Filling Pipe)

* Fills the tank
* Work done is **positive**

### 🔹 Outlet Pipe (Emptying Pipe)

* Empties the tank
* Work done is **negative**

📌 **Sign rule (VERY IMPORTANT):**

```
Filling pipe  →  +
Emptying pipe →  −
```

---

## 🧠 PART 3: Unit Tank Concept (FOUNDATION)

Always assume:

```
Total Tank = 1 unit
```

### Example

> A pipe fills a tank in 10 hours

```
1-hour work = 1/10 (tank per hour)
```

> A pipe empties a tank in 5 hours

```
1-hour work = −1/5
```

---

## 🧠 PART 4: Single Pipe Problems

### Example

> A pipe can fill a tank in 12 hours.
> How much tank does it fill in 3 hours?

```
1-hour fill = 1/12
3-hour fill = 3/12 = 1/4
```

✔ **Answer: 1/4 tank filled**

---

## 🧠 PART 5: Two Filling Pipes Working Together

### Formula

If:

* Pipe A fills in **x hours**
* Pipe B fills in **y hours**

Then:

```
1-hour fill = (1/x + 1/y)
Time = 1 / (1/x + 1/y)
```

---

### Example

> Pipe A fills in 10 hours
> Pipe B fills in 20 hours
> Find time together

```
1-hour fill = 1/10 + 1/20 = 3/20
Time = 20/3 hours
```

✔ **Answer = 6⅔ hours**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Filling + Emptying Pipe (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

### Example

> A pipe fills a tank in 12 hours
> An outlet pipe empties it in 6 hours
> Both opened together — find time to fill tank

```
Net work per hour = 1/12 − 1/6
= 1/12 − 2/12
= −1/12
```

❌ Tank will **never fill**
✔ It empties instead

📌 **Always check the sign**

---

### Another Example

> Filling pipe: 8 hours
> Emptying pipe: 24 hours

```
Net = 1/8 − 1/24
= (3 − 1)/24
= 2/24 = 1/12
```

✔ Tank fills in **12 hours**

---

## 🧠 PART 7: Alternate Opening & Closing Pipes

### Typical Pattern

> A filling pipe works for some time,
> then an emptying pipe works for some time,
> repeatedly.

### Key Idea

```
Net work in 1 cycle = fill − empty
```

---

### Example

> Filling pipe fills tank in 6 hours
> Emptying pipe empties in 12 hours
> Filling works 1 hour, emptying works 1 hour (alternately)

```
Fill in 1 hr = 1/6
Empty in 1 hr = 1/12
Net in 2 hrs = 1/6 − 1/12 = 1/12
```

```
Total cycles needed = 1 ÷ (1/12) = 12 cycles
```

Each cycle = 2 hours
✔ **Total time = 24 hours**

## 🧪 PRACTICE (LEARNING MODE)

### Q1️⃣

A pipe can fill a tank in **15 hours**.
👉 How much tank does it fill in **3 hours**?

---

### Q2️⃣

Pipe A fills a tank in **12 hours**.
Pipe B fills it in **18 hours**.
👉 Find time taken when **both work together**.

---

### Q3️⃣

A pipe fills a tank in **10 hours**.
Another pipe empties it in **20 hours**.
👉 Find time to fill the tank if both are opened together.

---

### Q4️⃣ (Interview 🔥)

A filling pipe can fill a tank in **6 hours**.
An emptying pipe can empty it in **12 hours**.
Filling pipe works for **1 hour**, then emptying pipe works for **1 hour**, alternately.
👉 Find total time to fill the tank.

# ✅ Lesson 11 – Answer Check

## 🔹 Q1

**Fill in 15 hours → 3 hours**

```
1-hour fill = 1/15
3-hour fill = 3/15 = 1/5
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q2 (Needs correction )

**Pipe A = 12 hours, Pipe B = 18 hours**

```
1-hour fill = 1/12 + 1/18
= (3 + 2) / 36
= 5/36
```

```
Time = 36/5 hours = 7.2 hours = 7 1/5 hours
```


✅ **Correct answer: 7 1/5 hours**

📌 Small fraction addition slip — concept is right.

---

## 🔹 Q3

**Filling = 10 hours, Emptying = 20 hours**

```
Net rate = 1/10 − 1/20
= 1/20
```

```
Time = 20 hours
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q4

**Alternate filling & emptying**

Net work in 2 hours:

```
1/6 − 1/12 = 1/12
```

```
Cycles needed = 12
Total time = 12 × 2 = 24 hours
```

✅ **Correct**
