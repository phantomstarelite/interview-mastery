### 🔹 Even Numbers

➡ Numbers divisible by **2**

Examples:

* 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Rule:
[
\text{Even} \Rightarrow n \bmod 2 = 0
]

---

### 🔹 Odd Numbers

➡ Numbers **not divisible** by 2

Examples:

* 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Rule:
[
\text{Odd} \Rightarrow n \bmod 2 = 1
]

## ⚡ Super Important Rules (Interview Gold)

| Operation   | Result |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Even + Even | Even   |
| Odd + Odd   | Even   |
| Even + Odd  | Odd    |
| Even × Any  | Even   |
| Odd × Odd   | Odd    |

📌 Example:

* 17 × 24 → **Even** (no need to calculate)

### 🔹 Prime Number

➡ Has **exactly 2 factors**
(1 and itself)

Examples:

* 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

⚠ Special case:

* **2 is the only even prime**

---

### 🔹 Composite Number

➡ Has **more than 2 factors**

Examples:

* 4 → (1, 2, 4)
* 6 → (1, 2, 3, 6)
* 9 → (1, 3, 9)

---

### ❌ Why 1 is NOT Prime (Very Common Question)

Factors of 1 = {1}

* Prime needs **2 factors**
* 1 has **only 1 factor**

👉 So, **1 is neither prime nor composite**

---

## 🧠 Quick Thinking Trick

To check prime (for small numbers):

* Try dividing by 2, 3, 5
* Only check up to √n

Example:

* 29 → √29 ≈ 5.3
  Check 2, 3, 5 → none divide → **prime**

---

## 🧪 Practice (Now Your Turn)

### Q1️⃣ Without calculating fully, tell **Even or Odd**

a) 245 × 376
b) 999 + 222
c) 111 × 333

---

### Q2️⃣ Prime or Composite?

a) 2
b) 15
c) 17
d) 1

---

### Q3️⃣ Interview Type Question

👉 **Is 0 even or odd? WHY?**

Great attempt, Pratik 👍
You’re **thinking**, which matters more than memorizing.
Let’s **check calmly**, fix **one small misconception**, and then lock the concept forever 🔒

---

## ✅ Answer Review (With Reasoning)

### ✔ Q1: Even / Odd

a) **245 × 376 → Even** ✅

> Odd × Even = **Even**

b) **999 + 222 → Odd** ✅

> Odd + Even = **Odd**

c) **111 × 333 → Odd** ✅

> Odd × Odd = **Odd**

👉 **All correct** 💯

---

### ✔ Q2: Prime / Composite

a) **2 → Prime** ✅
b) **15 → Composite** ✅
c) **17 → Prime** ✅
d) **1 → Neither prime nor composite** ✅

Perfect 👌

## ❗ Important Correction (Very Important for Interviews)

### ❌ Your Answer (Q3):

> “0 is neither even nor odd because even/odd are natural numbers”

This is a **very common misconception**.
Let’s fix it properly 👇

---

## ✅ Correct Concept: Is 0 Even or Odd?

### ✔ **0 is an EVEN number**

### Why? (Simple & Interview-Proof Explanation)

**Definition of even number:**

> A number divisible by 2 is even.

[
0 \div 2 = 0 \quad (\text{no remainder})
]

✔ So **0 is divisible by 2**
✔ Therefore, **0 is EVEN**

---

### 🚫 Important Clarification

* Even/odd applies to **integers**, not only natural numbers
* Integers include: **…, −2, 0, 2, 4, …**

---

### 🗣️ Interview-Ready Answer (Say This):

> “0 is an even number because it is divisible by 2 and gives remainder 0.”

That’s it. Clean. Correct. Confident. 💪

---

## 🧠 Why Interviewers Love This Question

They want to check:

* Do you know **definitions**, not assumptions
* Can you **justify logically**
* Do you panic on simple questions?

You won’t now 😄

---

## 🧪 Mini Reinforcement (Quick)

Answer mentally:

* Is −4 even? → **Yes**
* Is −3 odd? → **Yes**

(Even/odd depends on **divisibility**, not sign)
