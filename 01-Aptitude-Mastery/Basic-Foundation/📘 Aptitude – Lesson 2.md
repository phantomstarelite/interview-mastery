### 🔹 Even Numbers
➡ Numbers divisible by **2**

**Examples:**
- 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

**Rule:**
Even ⇒ n % 2 = 0

---

### 🔹 Odd Numbers
➡ Numbers **not divisible** by 2

**Examples:**
- 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

**Rule:**

Odd ⇒ n % 2 = 1

## ⚡ Super Important Rules (Interview Gold)

| Operation        | Result |
|------------------|--------|
| Even + Even      | Even   |
| Odd + Odd        | Even   |
| Even + Odd       | Odd    |
| Even × Any       | Even   |
| Odd × Odd        | Odd    |

📌 **Example:**
- 17 × 24 → **Even** (no need to calculate)

### 🔹 Prime Numbers
➡ Numbers having **exactly two factors**  
(1 and the number itself)

**Examples:**
- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

⚠ **Special Case:**
- **2 is the only even prime number**

---

### 🔹 Composite Numbers
➡ Numbers having **more than two factors**

**Examples:**
- 4 → (1, 2, 4)
- 6 → (1, 2, 3, 6)
- 9 → (1, 3, 9)

---

### ❌ Why 1 is NOT Prime (Very Common Question)

Factors of 1 = {1}

- Prime numbers need **exactly two factors**
- 1 has **only one factor**

👉 Therefore, **1 is neither prime nor composite**

---

## 🧠 Quick Thinking Trick (Prime Check)

To check whether a number is prime (small numbers):
- Try dividing by **2, 3, 5**
- Check divisibility only up to **√n**

**Example:**
- 29 → √29 ≈ 5.3  
  Check 2, 3, 5 → none divide → **Prime**

## 🧪 Practice (Now Your Turn)

### Q1️⃣ Without calculating fully, identify **Even or Odd**

a) 245 × 376  
b) 999 + 222  
c) 111 × 333  

---

### Q2️⃣ Prime or Composite?

a) 2  
b) 15  
c) 17  
d) 1  

---

### Q3️⃣ Interview-Type Question
👉 **Is 0 even or odd? Why?**

---

## ✅ Answer Review (With Reasoning)

### ✔ Q1: Even / Odd
- 245 × 376 → **Even**  
  (Odd × Even = Even)

- 999 + 222 → **Odd**  
  (Odd + Even = Odd)

- 111 × 333 → **Odd**  
  (Odd × Odd = Odd)

👉 **All correct** 💯

---

### ✔ Q2: Prime / Composite
- 2 → **Prime**
- 15 → **Composite**
- 17 → **Prime**
- 1 → **Neither prime nor composite**

---

## ❗ Important Correction (Interview Favorite)

### ❓ Is 0 Even or Odd?

### ✔ **0 is an EVEN number**

**Reason:**
> A number divisible by 2 is even.

0 ÷ 2 = 0 (no remainder)


✔ 0 is divisible by 2  
✔ Hence, **0 is even**

---

### 🚫 Important Clarification
- Even/odd applies to **integers**, not only natural numbers
- Integers include: …, −2, 0, 2, 4, …

---

### 🗣️ Interview-Ready Answer
> “0 is an even number because it is divisible by 2 and leaves remainder 0.”

---

## 🧪 Mini Reinforcement
- Is −4 even? → **Yes**
- Is −3 odd? → **Yes**

👉 Even/odd depends on **divisibility**, not the sign of the number.
