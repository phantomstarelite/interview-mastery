### ✔ Definition

A **factor** of a number is a number that **divides it completely** (no remainder).

Example:
Factors of **12**:

[
12 \div 1 = 12
12 \div 2 = 6
12 \div 3 = 4
]

So factors of 12 = **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**

### 🔑 Key Properties of Factors

* Factors are **finite**
* **1** is factor of every number
* Every number is factor of **itself**
* Small numbers → fewer factors

### ✔ Definition

A **multiple** is obtained by **multiplying** the number by 1, 2, 3, …

Example:
Multiples of **4**:

[
4×1=4,; 4×2=8,; 4×3=12,; 4×4=16
]

Multiples of 4 = **4, 8, 12, 16, 20, …**

---

### 🔑 Key Properties of Multiples

* Multiples are **infinite**
* The number itself is the **first multiple**
* Multiples grow **bigger and bigger**

## 🔁 Factors vs Multiples (Never Confuse Again)

| Factors           | Multiples           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Divide the number | Multiply the number |
| Finite            | Infinite            |
| Smaller or equal  | Larger or equal     |
| End at the number | Go on forever       |

## 🧠 Part 3: How to Find Factors FAST (Interview Trick)

Example: Find factors of **36**

Only check till **√36 = 6**

Pairs:

* (1, 36)
* (2, 18)
* (3, 12)
* (4, 9)
* (6, 6)

👉 Factors = **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36**

⚡ This saves time.

### ✔ What is it?

Breaking a number into **prime numbers only**.

Example:
[
36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2^2 × 3^2
]

Another:
[
60 = 2^2 × 3 × 5
]

📌 Every number has a **unique prime factorization**
