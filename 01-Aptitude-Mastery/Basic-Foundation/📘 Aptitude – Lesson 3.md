### ✔ Definition
A **factor** of a number is a number that **divides it completely** (with no remainder).

**Example:**  
Factors of **12**

12 ÷ 1 = 12  
12 ÷ 2 = 6  
12 ÷ 3 = 4


So, factors of 12 are:  
**1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**

---

### 🔑 Key Properties of Factors
- Factors are **finite**
- **1** is a factor of every number
- Every number is a factor of **itself**
- Smaller numbers generally have **fewer factors**

---

### ✔ Definition
A **multiple** is obtained by **multiplying** a number by 1, 2, 3, …

**Example:**  
Multiples of **4**

4 × 1 = 4  
4 × 2 = 8  
4 × 3 = 12  
4 × 4 = 16


Multiples of 4 are:  
**4, 8, 12, 16, 20, …**

---

### 🔑 Key Properties of Multiples
- Multiples are **infinite**
- The number itself is the **first multiple**
- Multiples keep growing **larger**

## 🔁 Factors vs Multiples (Never Confuse Again)

| Factors            | Multiples           |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Divide the number  | Multiply the number |
| Finite             | Infinite            |
| Smaller or equal   | Larger or equal     |
| End at the number  | Go on forever       |

## 🧠 Part 3: How to Find Factors FAST (Interview Trick)

**Example:** Find factors of **36**

Only check numbers up to:  
√36 = **6**

**Pairs:**
- (1, 36)
- (2, 18)
- (3, 12)
- (4, 9)
- (6, 6)

👉 Factors of 36:  
**1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36**

⚡ This method saves time in exams.

---

### ✔ What is Prime Factorization?
Breaking a number into **prime numbers only**.

**Example:**

36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 2² × 3² 

**Another example:**

60 = 2² × 3 × 5


📌 Every number has a **unique prime factorization**.
