### 🔹 Meaning

**Percent = per hundred**

[
x% = \frac{x}{100}
]

So:

* 1% = 1 out of 100
* 50% = 50 out of 100
* 100% = whole value

### 🔍 Real-life intuition

* If you score **75%**, it means **75 marks out of 100**
* If price increases by **10%**, it increases by **10 per 100**

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Percentage ↔ Fraction ↔ Decimal (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🔹 Percentage → Fraction

Just divide by 100 and simplify.

| Percentage | Fraction |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 50%        | 1/2      |
| 25%        | 1/4      |
| 20%        | 1/5      |
| 12.5%      | 1/8      |
| 10%        | 1/10     |

📌 **Memory Tip:**
12.5% = **1/8** (very common in exams)

---

### 🔹 Percentage → Decimal

Move decimal **two places left**.

* 25% = 0.25
* 7% = 0.07
* 0.5% = 0.005

---

### 🔹 Fraction → Percentage

Multiply by 100.

* 1/2 = 50%
* 3/4 = 75%
* 1/5 = 20%

### 🔹 Formula

[
x% \text{ of } y = \frac{x}{100} \times y
]

### 🔹 Examples (Step-by-step)

**Example 1:**
20% of 150
[
= \frac{20}{100} \times 150 = 30
]

**Example 2:**
12.5% of 80
12.5% = 1/8
[
80 \div 8 = 10
]

⚡ **Fast Tricks**

* 10% → divide by 10
* 20% → double of 10%
* 50% → half
* 25% → quarter

## 🧠 PART 4: Percentage Increase & Decrease (CORE TOPIC)

---

### 🔹 Percentage Increase

[
%\text{ Increase} = \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original}} \times 100
]

**Example:**
Salary increases from 20,000 to 25,000
Increase = 5,000

[
\frac{5000}{20000} \times 100 = 25%
]

---

### 🔹 Percentage Decrease

[
%\text{ Decrease} = \frac{\text{Decrease}}{\text{Original}} \times 100
]

**Example:**
Price decreases from 800 to 600
Decrease = 200

[
\frac{200}{800} \times 100 = 25%
]

---

## 🧠 PART 5: Successive Percentage Change (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

### ❗ BIG TRAP

Increase by **x%** and decrease by **x%**
❌ You do NOT return to original value

---

### 🔹 Formula (Must Remember)

If increased by x% and then decreased by x%:

[
\text{Net Change} = -\frac{x^2}{100}
]

Meaning → **LOSS**

---

### 🔹 Example (Slow & Clear)

Let value = 100
Increase by 10% → 110
Decrease by 10% → 99

👉 **Net loss = 1%**

---

### 🔹 Example 2:

Increase by 20%, then decrease by 20%

[
\frac{20^2}{100} = 4%
]

👉 **4% loss**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Percentage Comparison (Hidden Concept)

### Example:

A is **25% more** than B
👉 Then B is **20% less** than A

Why?

* Let B = 100
* A = 125
* Difference = 25

[
\frac{25}{125} \times 100 = 20%
]

📌 **Direction matters**

---

## 🧪 PRACTICE (Detailed – Do Slowly)

### Q1️⃣ Convert:

a) 12.5% → fraction
b) 0.25 → percentage

---

### Q2️⃣ Find:

a) 30% of 240
b) 15% of 60

---

### Q3️⃣ Price changes from 500 to 650

👉 Find percentage increase

---

### Q4️⃣ Interview Question

A value is increased by **20%** and then decreased by **10%**.
👉 Find the **net percentage change** (profit/loss).

---

## Solution :

Nice attempt, Pratik 👍
You’ve got the **ideas**, just a few **calculation-direction slips**. That’s normal at this stage. Let’s correct them **calmly** and make them interview-perfect.

---

## ✅ Answer Review (With Fixes)

### 🔹 Q1: Conversion

**a) 12.5% → fraction**
Your answer: **1/8** ✅ Correct

**b) 0.25 → percentage**
Your answer: **25%** ✅ Correct

✔ Q1 is **100% right**

---

### 🔹 Q2: Find the value

**a) 30% of 240**
You wrote: **72%** ❌
👉 Careful: question asks for **value**, not percentage.

Correct method:
[
30% \text{ of } 240 = \frac{30}{100} \times 240 = 72
]

✅ **Correct answer: 72**

---

**b) 15% of 60**
You wrote: **9%** ❌
Again, value is needed.

[
15% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{15}{100} \times 60 = 9
]

✅ **Correct answer: 9**

📌 **Big Rule to Lock 🔒**

* “% of” → final answer is a **number**, not a percent

---

### 🔹 Q3: Percentage Increase

Price changes from **500 → 650**

Increase = 150

[
\frac{150}{500} \times 100 = 30%
]

✅ **Your answer: 30% — Correct**

---

### 🔹 Q4: Successive Change (Interview Level)

Increase by **20%**, then decrease by **10%**

Let original value = 100
After 20% increase → 120
After 10% decrease → 108

Net change = **+8**

[
\Rightarrow 8% \text{ profit}
]

✅ **Your answer: 8% — Correct**
