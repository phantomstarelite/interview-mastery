### 🔹 Meaning
**Percent = per hundred**

x% = x / 100


So:
- 1% = 1 out of 100  
- 50% = 50 out of 100  
- 100% = whole value  

### 🔍 Real-life Intuition
- 75% marks = 75 marks out of 100  
- Price increases by 10% = increase of 10 per 100  

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Percentage ↔ Fraction ↔ Decimal (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🔹 Percentage → Fraction
Divide by 100 and simplify.

| Percentage | Fraction |
|-----------|----------|
| 50% | 1/2 |
| 25% | 1/4 |
| 20% | 1/5 |
| 12.5% | 1/8 |
| 10% | 1/10 |

📌 **Memory Tip:**  
12.5% = **1/8** (very common in exams)

---

### 🔹 Percentage → Decimal
Move the decimal **two places left**.

- 25% = 0.25  
- 7% = 0.07  
- 0.5% = 0.005  

---

### 🔹 Fraction → Percentage
Multiply by 100.

- 1/2 = 50%  
- 3/4 = 75%  
- 1/5 = 20%  

---

---

### 🔹 Formula

x% of y = (x / 100) × y


### 🔹 Examples

**Example 1:**  
20% of 150

(20 / 100) × 150 = 30


**Example 2:**  
12.5% of 80  
12.5% = 1/8

80 ÷ 8 = 10


⚡ **Fast Tricks**
- 10% → divide by 10  
- 20% → double of 10%  
- 50% → half  
- 25% → quarter

## 🧠 PART 4: Percentage Increase & Decrease (CORE TOPIC)

![Percentage Change](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54905286e4b050812345644c/1675281373529-I6KZEQ9P9I72DAQB2AK7/Percent-Change-Banner.jpg)

---

### 🔹 Percentage Increase

% Increase = (Increase / Original) × 100


**Example:**  
Salary increases from 20,000 to 25,000  
Increase = 5,000

(5000 / 20000) × 100 = 25%


---

### 🔹 Percentage Decrease

% Decrease = (Decrease / Original) × 100


**Example:**  
Price decreases from 800 to 600  
Decrease = 200

(200 / 800) × 100 = 25%


---

## 🧠 PART 5: Successive Percentage Change (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

### ❗ BIG TRAP
Increase by **x%** and decrease by **x%**  
❌ You do **not** return to the original value

---

### 🔹 Formula (Must Remember)
If increased by x% and then decreased by x%:

Net Change = −(x² / 100)

👉 Always results in **LOSS**

---

### 🔹 Example
Let value = 100  
Increase by 10% → 110  
Decrease by 10% → 99  

👉 **Net loss = 1%**

---

### 🔹 Example 2
Increase by 20%, then decrease by 20%

20² / 100 = 4%

👉 **4% loss**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Percentage Comparison (Hidden Concept)

### Example
A is **25% more** than B  
👉 Then B is **20% less** than A

**Explanation:**
- Let B = 100  
- A = 125  
- Difference = 25  

(25 / 125) × 100 = 20%


📌 **Direction matters**
