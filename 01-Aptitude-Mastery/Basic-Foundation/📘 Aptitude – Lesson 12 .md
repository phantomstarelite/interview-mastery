# 📘 Aptitude – Lesson 12 (Learning Mode)

## 🏃 Time, Speed & Distance — From Zero to Interview Level

> If **Time & Work** teaches *rate of work*,
> **Time–Speed–Distance (TSD)** teaches *rate of motion*.

## 🧠 PART 1: The Golden Formula (NEVER FORGET)

```
Speed = Distance / Time
Distance = Speed × Time
Time = Distance / Speed
```

📌 Every TSD question is just **one of these three**.

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Units & Conversions (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

### 🔹 Standard Units

* Speed → km/hr or m/s
* Distance → km or m
* Time → hr or sec

### 🔁 MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSION

```
1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s
1 m/s  = 18/5 km/hr
```

### Example

Convert **36 km/hr** to m/s:

```
36 × 5/18 = 10 m/s
```

Convert **10 m/s** to km/hr:

```
10 × 18/5 = 36 km/hr
```

---

## 🧠 PART 3: Average Speed (VERY COMMON)

### ❗ BIG TRAP

Average speed is **NOT** the average of speeds (most of the time).

### Formula

```
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
```

---

### Special Case (Equal Distance)

If a person covers equal distances at speeds **x** and **y**:

```
Average Speed = 2xy / (x + y)
```

---

### Example

A person travels:

* 60 km at 30 km/hr
* 60 km at 60 km/hr

```
Avg speed = 2 × 30 × 60 / (30 + 60)
          = 40 km/hr
```

---

## 🧠 PART 4: Relative Speed (INTERVIEW GOLD)

### 🔹 Same Direction

```
Relative Speed = |v1 − v2|
```

### 🔹 Opposite Direction

```
Relative Speed = v1 + v2
```

---

### Example

Two cars move at **60 km/hr** and **40 km/hr**

* Same direction → `20 km/hr`
* Opposite direction → `100 km/hr`

---

## 🧠 PART 5: Trains Crossing Objects (MOST ASKED)

### Train crossing a **pole / man / signal**

```
Time = Length of train / Speed
```

### Train crossing a **platform / bridge**

```
Time = (Length of train + Length of platform) / Speed
```

---

### Example

Train length = 200 m
Speed = 72 km/hr

Convert speed:

```
72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s
```

Time to cross a pole:

```
200 / 20 = 10 seconds
```

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Boats & Streams (INTRO)

> River questions = **relative speed in disguise**

### Definitions

* **Still Water Speed (u)**
* **Stream Speed (v)**

```
Downstream speed = u + v
Upstream speed   = u − v
```

We’ll do this **deeply in Lesson 13**.

---

## 🧠 PART 7: Common Mistakes (AVOID ❌)

* ❌ Forgetting unit conversion
* ❌ Averaging speeds directly
* ❌ Using wrong relative speed direction
* ❌ Mixing distance & time units

---

## 🧪 PRACTICE (LEARNING MODE)

### Q1️⃣

A car travels **120 km in 3 hours**.
👉 Find its **speed**.

---

### Q2️⃣

Convert **54 km/hr** into **m/s**.

---

### Q3️⃣

A person travels **equal distances** at **40 km/hr** and **60 km/hr**.
👉 Find **average speed**.

---

### Q4️⃣ (Interview 🔥)

Two trains move at **50 km/hr** and **70 km/hr** in **opposite directions**.
👉 Find their **relative speed**.




# ✅ Lesson 12 – Solutions

---

## 🔹 Q1

A car travels **120 km in 3 hours**.
👉 Find speed.

Formula:

```
Speed = Distance / Time
```

```
Speed = 120 / 3 = 40 km/hr
```

✅ **Answer: 40 km/hr**

---

## 🔹 Q2

Convert **54 km/hr** into **m/s**

Use conversion:

```
km/hr × 5/18
```

```
54 × 5/18
= 3 × 5
= 15 m/s
```

✅ **Answer: 15 m/s**

---

## 🔹 Q3

Equal distances at **40 km/hr** and **60 km/hr**

Use special formula:

```
Average Speed = 2xy / (x + y)
```

```
= 2 × 40 × 60 / (40 + 60)
= 4800 / 100
= 48 km/hr
```

⚠ Notice:
Average is **NOT 50**
(very common trap)

✅ **Answer: 48 km/hr**

---

## 🔹 Q4

Two trains move at **50 km/hr** and **70 km/hr** in **opposite directions**

Opposite direction rule:

```
Relative Speed = v1 + v2
```

```
= 50 + 70 = 120 km/hr
```

✅ **Answer: 120 km/hr**
