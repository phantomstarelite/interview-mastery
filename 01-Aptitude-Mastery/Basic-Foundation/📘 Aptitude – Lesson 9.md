## 🧠 PART 1: Core Terms (Again, but Deeper)

### 🔹 Marked Price (MP)
- The **label price** shown on the item  
- Also called **List Price**

### 🔹 Selling Price (SP)
- The **actual price paid** by the customer

### 🔹 Discount
Reduction given on MP

```

Discount = MP − SP

```

### 🔹 Discount Percentage

```

Discount % = (Discount / MP) × 100

```

📌 **Golden Rule:**  
> Discount is **always calculated on MP**, never on CP.

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Direct Discount Formula (Must Know)

If discount = **x%**

```

SP = MP × (1 − x/100)

```

### Example 1
MP = 1500, Discount = 20%

```

SP = 1500 × 0.8 = 1200

```

### Example 2
MP = 800, Discount = 12.5%

12.5% = 1/8

SP = 800 × (7/8) = 700



---

## 🧠 PART 3: Successive Discounts (Very Important)

![Two Discounts](https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/n3c1o6w97b.jpg)


When **more than one discount** is applied **one after another**, not together.

### Example (Slow & Clear)

MP = 1000  
Discounts = **20% and 10%**

After 20% discount:

1000 × 0.8 = 800


After 10% discount:

800 × 0.9 = 720


✔ Final SP = **720**

❌ **NOT** 30% discount  
(this is the biggest trap)

---

## 🧠 PART 4: Equivalent Discount (Shortcut)

Instead of two steps, we find **one equivalent discount**.

### Formula
If discounts are **a% and b%**



Equivalent Discount = a + b − (ab / 100)

### Example
Discounts = 20% and 10%


= 20 + 10 − (20×10)/100  
= 30 − 2  
= 28%


✔ Same result:


1000 × 0.72 = 720

## 🧠 PART 5: Discount + Profit (MOST ASKED)

![Profit & Discount](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/profit-and-loss-formula-1621864732.png)

### Typical Question
> A shopkeeper marks goods **40% above CP** and gives **20% discount**.  
> Find **profit %**.

### Step-by-Step (Learning Style)

Let CP = 100

Marked Price:

MP = 140

```

After 20% discount:
```

SP = 140 × 0.8 = 112

```

Profit:
```

112 − 100 = 12


✔ **Profit = 12%**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Trap Awareness (Read Carefully)

### ❌ Trap 1: Adding discounts
- 20% + 10% ≠ 30%

### ❌ Trap 2: Profit on MP
- Profit is **always calculated on CP**

### ❌ Trap 3: Jumping to formula without structure
Always follow:
```
CP → MP → SP
```

# 📘 Lesson 9 – Answer Check

## 🔹 Q1  
**MP = 2000, Discount = 15%**

```

SP = 2000 × 0.85 = 1700

```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q2  
**MP = 1000, Discounts = 10% and 20%**

After 10% discount:
```

1000 × 0.9 = 900

```

After 20% discount:
```

900 × 0.8 = 720

```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q3  
**Equivalent discount of 25% and 10%**

Formula:
```

Equivalent Discount = a + b − (ab / 100)

```

Substitute values:
```

= 25 + 10 − (25×10)/100  
= 35 − 2.5  
= 32.5%

```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q4 (IMPORTANT ❗)  
**Marked 50% above CP, Discount = 20%**

You answered: **20**  
⚠️ Value was correct, but the **unit was missing**.

### Step-by-step (Rule: CP → MP → SP)

Let CP = 100

Marked 50% above CP:
```

MP = 150

```

After 20% discount:
```

SP = 150 × 0.8 = 120

```

Profit:
```

120 − 100 = 20

```

Profit percentage:
```

(20 / 100) × 100 = 20%

```

✅ **Correct final answer: 20% PROFIT**
