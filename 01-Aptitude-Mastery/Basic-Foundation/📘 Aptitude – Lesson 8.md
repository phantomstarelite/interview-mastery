## 🧠 PART 1: Basic Terms (ABSOLUTE FOUNDATION)

![Profit Loss Concept](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/profit-and-loss-formula-1621864732.png)

---

### 🔹 Cost Price (CP)
➡ The price at which an item is **bought**

**Example:**
- You buy a pen for ₹10  
  → **CP = 10**

---

### 🔹 Selling Price (SP)
➡ The price at which an item is **sold**

**Example:**
- You sell the pen for ₹12  
  → **SP = 12**

---

### 🔹 Profit (Gain)
When **SP > CP**

Profit = SP − CP


**Example:**
- CP = 100, SP = 120  
  → Profit = **20**

---

### 🔹 Loss
When **SP < CP**

Loss = CP − SP


**Example:**
- CP = 100, SP = 80  
  → Loss = **20**

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Profit % and Loss %

![Profit Loss Formula](https://cdn.teachoo.com/dfcb096c-44e6-4da1-9bd1-79d68f30e596/20.jpg)

---

### 🔹 Profit %

Profit % = (Profit / CP) × 100


### 🔹 Loss %

Loss % = (Loss / CP) × 100


📌 **Always divide by CP**, not SP  
*(very common exam trap)*

---

## 🧠 PART 3: Direct Formula Method (TIME SAVER)

If profit = **x%**

SP = CP × (1 + x/100)


If loss = **x%**

SP = CP × (1 − x/100)


---

### 🔹 Example (Profit)
CP = 500, profit = 20%

SP = 500 × 1.2 = 600


---

### 🔹 Example (Loss)
CP = 400, loss = 10%

SP = 400 × 0.9 = 360


---

## 🧠 PART 4: Marked Price (MP) & Discount (INTRO)

![Marked Price Discount](https://passyworldofmathematics.com/Images/pwmImagesFour/FinMathOne550x402JPG.jpg)

---

### 🔹 Marked Price (MP)
➡ Price written on the product (label price)

---

### 🔹 Discount
Reduction given on MP

Discount = MP − SP


### 🔹 Discount %

Discount % = (Discount / MP) × 100


---

### 🔹 Example
MP = 1000  
Discount = 20%

SP = 1000 × 0.8 = 800

---

## 🧠 PART 5: Very Common Interview Traps

### ❌ Trap 1: Same % profit and loss
- 20% profit ≠ 20% loss

### ❌ Trap 2: Profit % on SP
- Profit % is **always calculated on CP**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Interview Shortcut Ratios (GOLD)

| Profit / Loss | CP : SP |
|--------------|---------|
| 20% profit   | 5 : 6   |
| 25% profit   | 4 : 5   |
| 20% loss     | 5 : 4   |
| 10% loss     | 10 : 9  |

⏱️ These save **minutes** in MCQs.

# ✅ Profit & Loss – Solutions Only

---

## Q1️⃣  
**CP = ₹800, SP = ₹1000**

- Profit = 1000 − 800 = **₹200**
- Profit % = (200 / 800) × 100 = **25%**

---

## Q2️⃣  
**SP = ₹900, Loss = 10%**

- SP = 90% of CP  
- CP = (900 × 100) / 90 = **₹1000**

---

## Q3️⃣  
**MP = ₹2000, Discount = 25%**

- SP = 75% of MP  
- SP = 0.75 × 2000 = **₹1500**

---

## Q4️⃣  
**Two items sold at ₹1000 each**

### Item 1 (25% gain)

CP₁ = (1000 × 100) / 125 = 800


### Item 2 (25% loss)

CP₂ = (1000 × 100) / 75 ≈ 1333.33


### Totals
- Total CP = 800 + 1333.33 = **₹2133.33**
- Total SP = 2000

### Result
- Overall **LOSS = ₹133.33**

---

### 🔒 Key Result
If **SP is same** and **profit % = loss %**,  
👉 the result is **always LOSS**.
