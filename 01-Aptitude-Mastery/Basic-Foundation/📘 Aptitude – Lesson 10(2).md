## 🧠 PART 7: Work Done & Work Left (CORE INTERVIEW IDEA)

### 🔑 Rule

```
Total Work = 1 (unit)
Work Done + Work Left = 1
```

---

### Example 1

> A can complete a work in **10 days**.
> How much work is done in **4 days**?

```
1-day work = 1/10
Work done in 4 days = 4/10 = 2/5
```

✔ **Answer: 2/5 work done**

---

### Example 2

> A can do a work in 12 days.
> He works for 3 days.
> How much work is left?

```
1-day work = 1/12
Work done = 3/12 = 1/4
Work left = 1 − 1/4 = 3/4
```

✔ **Answer: 3/4 work left**

---

## 🧠 PART 8: People Leaving the Work (VERY COMMON)

### Typical Pattern

> A and B together can do a work in **x days**.
> After **k days**, one person leaves.
> Remaining work is done by the other.

---

### Example (Step-by-step)

> A and B together can complete a work in **12 days**.
> They work together for **4 days**, then **B leaves**.
> A alone finishes the rest in **8 days**.
> Find how long **A alone** takes to do the whole work.

---

### Step 1: Together work

```
1-day work (A + B) = 1/12
Work done in 4 days = 4/12 = 1/3
```

### Step 2: Work left

```
Work left = 1 − 1/3 = 2/3
```

### Step 3: A alone does 2/3 work in 8 days

```
A's 1-day work = (2/3) ÷ 8 = 1/12
```

✔ A alone can complete the work in **12 days**

---

## 🧠 PART 9: People Joining the Work

### Typical Pattern

> A starts alone.
> After some days, B joins.
> Total work finishes in given time.

---

### Example

> A can do a work in **20 days**.
> He works alone for **5 days**, then B joins.
> They finish remaining work in **10 days**.
> Find how long **B alone** can do the work.

---

### Step 1: A’s work

```
1-day work of A = 1/20
Work done in 5 days = 5/20 = 1/4
```

### Step 2: Work left

```
Work left = 3/4
```

### Step 3: (A + B) do 3/4 work in 10 days

```
(A + B) 1-day work = (3/4) ÷ 10 = 3/40
```

### Step 4: Find B’s work

```
B = (A + B) − A
B = 3/40 − 1/20
B = 3/40 − 2/40 = 1/40
```

✔ B alone can do the work in **40 days**

---

## 🧠 PART 10: Efficiency-Based Shortcut (INTERVIEW GOLD)

If:

* A is **x% more efficient** than B

Then:

```
A : B = (100 + x) : 100
```

### Example

> A is 25% more efficient than B

```
A : B = 125 : 100 = 5 : 4
```

---

## 🧠 PART 11: Common Mistakes (AVOID THESE ❌)

* ❌ Mixing **days** directly instead of converting to **1-day work**
* ❌ Forgetting to subtract work already done
* ❌ Adding efficiencies incorrectly
* ❌ Jumping to shortcut without understanding

---

## 🧪 PRACTICE (INTERVIEW LEVEL)

### Q1️⃣

A can do a work in **15 days**.
He works for **5 days**.
👉 What fraction of work is **left**?

---

### Q2️⃣

A and B together can do a work in **10 days**.
They work together for **4 days**, then A leaves.
B finishes remaining work in **6 days**.
👉 Find time taken by **B alone** to do the whole work.

---

### Q3️⃣

A starts work alone and can finish in **18 days**.
After **6 days**, B joins.
They complete the work in **6 more days**.
👉 Find time taken by **B alone**.

---

### Q4️⃣ (Efficiency 🔥)

A is **40% more efficient** than B.
👉 Find the ratio of their efficiencies.






# ✅ Lesson 10 (Part 2) – Answer Check

## 🔹 Q1

**A can do work in 15 days, works for 5 days**

```
1-day work = 1/15
Work done = 5/15 = 1/3
Work left = 1 − 1/3 = 2/3
```

✅ **Your answer: 2/3 — Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q2

**A + B = 10 days**
Work together for **4 days**, then **A leaves**
B finishes remaining work in **6 days**

### Step 1: Work done together

```
1-day work (A+B) = 1/10
Work done in 4 days = 4/10 = 2/5
```

### Step 2: Work left

```
1 − 2/5 = 3/5
```

### Step 3: B alone does 3/5 work in 6 days

```
B's 1-day work = (3/5) ÷ 6 = 3/30 = 1/10
```


✅ **Correct answer: 10 days**


## 🔹 Q3

**A alone = 18 days**
Works alone for **6 days**, then B joins
Finishes in **6 more days**

### Step 1: A’s work

```
1-day work of A = 1/18
Work done in 6 days = 6/18 = 1/3
```

### Step 2: Work left

```
1 − 1/3 = 2/3
```

### Step 3: (A+B) do 2/3 work in 6 days

```
(A+B) 1-day work = (2/3) ÷ 6 = 2/18 = 1/9
```

### Step 4: Find B’s work

```
B = (A+B) − A
B = 1/9 − 1/18 = 1/18
```


✅ **Correct answer: 18 days**

📌 Again, you found **rate**, not **time**.

---

## 🔹 Q4

**A is 40% more efficient than B**

```
A : B = (100 + 40) : 100 = 140 : 100 = 7 : 5
```

✅ **Your answer: 7 : 5 — Correct**
