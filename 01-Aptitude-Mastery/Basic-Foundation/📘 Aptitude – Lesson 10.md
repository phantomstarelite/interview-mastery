## 🧠 PART 1: The Core Idea (MOST IMPORTANT)

👉 **Work depends on rate and time**

Think like this:

- **More people → work finishes faster**
    
- **Fewer people → work takes longer**
    

### 🔑 Golden Relationship

```
Work = Rate × Time
```

This single idea runs the **entire chapter**.

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Unit Work Concept (FOUNDATION)

Instead of thinking in “days”, we think in **work per day**.

### Example 1 (Very Basic)

> A can complete a work in 10 days.

That means:

```
Work done by A in 1 day = 1/10
```

### Example 2

> B can complete a work in 5 days.

```
Work done by B in 1 day = 1/5
```

📌 **Interview rule:**  
Always convert **days → 1 day work**

---

## 🧠 PART 3: Working Together (MOST ASKED)

### Formula (Very Important)

If

- A does work in **x days**
    
- B does work in **y days**
    

Then together:

```
1 day work = (1/x + 1/y)
```

Time taken together:

```
Time = 1 / (1/x + 1/y)
```

---

### Example 1 (Step-by-step)

> A can do a work in 10 days  
> B can do the same work in 20 days  
> Find time taken together

**Step 1: 1-day work**

```
A = 1/10
B = 1/20
```

**Step 2: Add**

```
1/10 + 1/20 = 3/20
```

**Step 3: Total time**

```
Time = 20/3 days
```

✔ **Answer = 6⅔ days**

---

## 🧠 PART 4: Shortcut Method (After Understanding)

If A takes **x days** and B takes **y days**:

```
Time together = (x × y) / (x + y)
```

### Same Example Check

```
(10 × 20) / (10 + 20) = 200 / 30 = 20/3 days
```

✔ Same answer ✅

📌 **Use shortcut only after concept is clear**

---

## 🧠 PART 5: Men–Days–Work Logic

![Image](https://www.careerride.com/Image/Aptitude/work-and-time-1486-13.png)

### Core Rule

```
More men → fewer days
Fewer men → more days
```

👉 Men and Days are **inversely proportional**

---

### Example

> 5 men can complete a work in 12 days  
> How many days will 10 men take?

```
5 × 12 = 10 × x
x = 6 days
```

✔ **Answer = 6 days**

---

## 🧠 PART 6: Efficiency Concept (INTERVIEW GOLD)

If:

- A is **twice as efficient** as B
    

Then:

```
A : B = 2 : 1
```

Which means:

- A does **2 units**
    
- B does **1 unit** in same time
    

📌 Efficiency ∝ Work done per day

---

## 🧪 PRACTICE (Do Slowly – Learning Mode)

### Q1️⃣

A can complete a work in **12 days**.  
👉 What part of work does A do in **1 day**?

---

### Q2️⃣

A can do a work in **10 days**, B in **15 days**.  
👉 Find time taken when **both work together**

---

### Q3️⃣

6 men can complete a work in **20 days**.  
👉 How many days will **12 men** take?

---

### Q4️⃣ (Interview Type 🔥)

A is **50% more efficient** than B.  
👉 Find the **ratio of their efficiencies**

--- 


# ✅ Lesson 10 – Answer Check (Part 1)

## 🔹 Q1

**A can complete a work in 12 days**

Work done in **1 day**:

```
= 1 / 12
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q2

**A = 10 days, B = 15 days**

**Step 1: 1-day work**

```
A = 1/10
B = 1/15
```

**Step 2: Add**

```
1/10 + 1/15
= (3 + 2) / 30
= 5/30
= 1/6
```

So together:

```
Time = 6 days
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q3

**6 men → 20 days**  
**12 men → ? days**

Men × Days = constant

```
6 × 20 = 12 × x
x = 10 days
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔹 Q4 (Important Concept Check)

**A is 50% more efficient than B**

This means:

- B = 100 units
    
- A = 150 units
    

Efficiency ratio:

```
A : B = 150 : 100 = 3 : 2
```

✅ **Correct**

---

## 🔒 What You’ve Mastered So Far

✔ Unit work  
✔ Working together  
✔ Men–days logic  
✔ Efficiency ratios
