### ✔ Meaning

The **largest number** that divides **both numbers exactly**

Example:
Find HCF of **12 and 18**

* Factors of 12 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
* Factors of 18 → 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

👉 Common factors: **1, 2, 3, 6**
✔ **HCF = 6**

## 🧠 Part 2: What is LCM? (Least Common Multiple)

### ✔ Meaning

The **smallest number** that both numbers can divide into

Example:
Find LCM of **4 and 6**

* Multiples of 4 → 4, 8, 12, 16…
* Multiples of 6 → 6, 12, 18…

✔ **LCM = 12**

---

## ⚡ Best Method: Prime Factorization Method

### Example: LCM & HCF of **12 and 18**

Prime factorizations:

* 12 = 2² × 3
* 18 = 2 × 3²

### ✔ HCF Rule

👉 Take **common primes with smallest power**

[
\text{HCF} = 2^1 × 3^1 = 6
]

### ✔ LCM Rule

👉 Take **all primes with highest power**

[
\text{LCM} = 2^2 × 3^2 = 36
]

---

## 🧠 One Golden Formula (Interview Favorite)

[
\text{HCF} × \text{LCM} = \text{Product of the numbers}
]

Example:

* Numbers: 12, 18
* HCF = 6
* LCM = 36

[
6 × 36 = 12 × 18
]

✔ Always true (for two numbers)

---

## 🧪 Practice (Very Important – Do Carefully)

### Q1️⃣ Find **HCF and LCM** of **24 and 36**

---

### Q2️⃣ If HCF = 8 and LCM = 96 of two numbers,

👉 find the **product of the numbers**

---

### Q3️⃣ Interview Question

👉 Can **HCF be greater than one of the numbers**?
(Answer YES or NO + reason)
