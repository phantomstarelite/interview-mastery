---

### ✔ Meaning
The **largest number** that divides **both numbers exactly** (with no remainder).

### Example  
Find HCF of **12 and 18**

- Factors of 12 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  
- Factors of 18 → 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18  

👉 Common factors: **1, 2, 3, 6**  
✔ **HCF = 6**

## 🧠 Part 2: What is LCM? (Least Common Multiple)

---

### ✔ Meaning
The **smallest number** that both numbers can divide into exactly.

### Example  
Find LCM of **4 and 6**

- Multiples of 4 → 4, 8, 12, 16, …  
- Multiples of 6 → 6, 12, 18, …  

✔ **LCM = 12**

---

## ⚡ Best Method: Prime Factorization Method

### Example: LCM & HCF of **12 and 18**

**Prime factorizations:**

12 = 2² × 3  
18 = 2 × 3²


---

### ✔ HCF Rule
👉 Take **common prime factors with the smallest power**

HCF = 2¹ × 3¹ = 6


---

### ✔ LCM Rule
👉 Take **all prime factors with the highest power**

HCF × LCM = Product of the two numbers


### Example
- Numbers: 12 and 18  
- HCF = 6  
- LCM = 36  

6 × 36 = 12 × 18


✔ This formula is **always true for two numbers**.

## 🧪 Practice (Very Important – Do Carefully)

### Q1️⃣  
Find **HCF and LCM** of **24 and 36**

---

### Q2️⃣  
If HCF = **8** and LCM = **96** of two numbers,  
👉 find the **product of the numbers**

---

### Q3️⃣ Interview-Type Question  
👉 Can **HCF be greater than one of the numbers**?  
(Answer **YES or NO** with reason)
